Todo

* setup.py
* proper license
* implement unittests


Current Limitations and ideas
-------------------

* SPHINX is currently called from the command line. This can be done better using Sphinx builder class
* develop template files for different kind of usecases --> user should invest as less time as possible into understanding makotemplates
* SPHINX layout based on default setup, allow users to specify customized setup
* implement classes on that allow user to easily register data and write final YAML file
* implement a help routine that writes code smippets already in a way the user might need them
* handling of images; links as perspective
